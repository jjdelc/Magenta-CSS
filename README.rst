Magenta CSS Framework
=====================

The Magente CSS Framework aims to enforce one moto when styling a page:

    When setting a background color always set a foreground color

It achieves that by setting all elements' background and foreground color to Magenta (#F0F). So you *have* to set specific colors for everything in your style withouth relying on system colors that not everybody shares.

Usage
-----

Simply include Magenta CSS in your <head> element right before your site's css:

    `<link href="magenta.css" rel="stylesheet"/>`

Don't like Magenta?
-------------------

Magenta CSS framework comes in Cyan flavor. To use, include cyan.css instead ;)

Inspiration - Braindead CSS
===========================

The inspiration for this is what I'll call "braindead CSS", there's a sample .css file included with that name.

What Braindead CSS does is set only either background or system color in such a way that it will clash with someone's opposite settings, thus making some elements (name input fields) unusable.
